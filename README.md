# Distribution-Calcultor
A versatile distribution calculator for analyzing and computing statistical distributions. Supports various probability distributions, visualization, and real-world applications.
Here are some sample questions you can use to test each distribution:

Normal Distribution

"Find the Z-score for normal distribution with mean=50, std dev=10 at 60"

"Normal distribution: mean = 100, std dev = 15 at 85"

Binomial Distribution

"For a binomial distribution with n=10, p=0.3, find expected successes"

"Binomial distribution: n=20, p=0.5"

Poisson Distribution

"Poisson distribution with lambda=4. Find probabilities for 0 and 1 occurrences"

"Poisson: lambda = 2"

Uniform Distribution

"Uniform distribution where a=5, b=15. Find probability of selecting any number in this range"

"Uniform: a=2, b=10"

Exponential Distribution

"Exponential distribution with rate=0.2. Find expected time until next event"

"Exponential: rate=1.5"

Geometric Distribution

"Geometric distribution with p=0.3, find probability of first success on the 4th trial"

"Geometric: p=0.1, k=5"
